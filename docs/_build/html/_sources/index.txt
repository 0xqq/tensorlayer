`TensorLayer <https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer>`_ is a transparent
Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning library
built on the top of Google TensorFlow. It was designed to provide a higher-level
API to TensorFlow in order to speed-up experimentations. TensorLayer is easy to
extended and modified, suitable for both machine learning researches and
applications.

This documentation is not only for describing how to use the library but also
a tutorial to walk through different type of Neural Networks, Deep
Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing etc.

.. note::
   If you got problem to read the docs online, you could download the project
   on github, then go to ``/docs/_build/html/index.html`` to read the docs
   offline.

User Guide
------------

The TensorLayer user guide explains how to install TensorFlow, CUDA and cuDNN,
how to build and train neural networks using TensorLayer, and how to contribute
to the library as a developer.
